Virtual LDAP is set of perl scripts which allows you to augment data in your
existing LDAP server (which you don't want to modify) using ldap-rewrite.pl
(supporting rewrite of bind request, search requests and responses).

Alternative usage is to expose SQL database (currently Koha database with uses)
to some other system as LDAP server.


Install with:

  cd /srv
  svn co svn://svn.rot13.org/virtual-ldap/

  cd virtual-ldap
  ./bin/install-debian.sh


If you need to augment or mungle LDAP from upstream server start:

  ./bin/ldap-rewrite.pl

You might want to edit configuration at top of script itself, especially
overlay_prefix if you want your YAML data to be without it.

To augment data with your own, you should create files

  yaml/uid=login,dc=example,dc=com

If you have test user in your LDAP edit configuration file and run tests:

  cp t/config.pl.template t/config.pl
  vi t/config.pl
  ./t/ldap-rewrite.t


If you want to expose MySQL Koha database as LDAP server start:

  ./bin/ldap-koha.pl
